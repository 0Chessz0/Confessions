                   PRIVACY POLICY
===================================================

1. Data We Collect
-------------------
The Bot collects and stores the following **non-personal** data locally:

a. Server Configuration:
- Server ID and name (used for file names)
- Channel and role IDs for configured features
- Settings for premium features (e.g., embed theme, review queue, logging)

b. Operational Statistics:
- Total number of confessions, replies, and command executions
- Stored in a file named `stats.json` for aggregate reporting

c. Premium Server List:
- A list of server IDs that have premium access
- No payment or user data is stored (handled via third-party platform)

2. What We DO NOT Collect or Store
-----------------------------------
- We do NOT store Discord user IDs or usernames persistently.
- We do NOT collect or log message contents outside Discord.
- We do NOT store IP addresses or any metadata.
- Any temporary use of user objects (e.g., for rate limiting or logging) exists only **in memory** for a short time and is never saved to disk or transmitted externally.

3. Author Logging (Premium Feature)
------------------------------------
If author logging is enabled:
- The user ID and confession message are **sent only to a specified log channel** within the Discord server.
- No part of this information is stored, copied, or accessed by the Developer or outside services.
- Logging occurs in real-time and is handled entirely within Discord.

4. Data Sharing
----------------
We do NOT sell, share, or rent your data.
All configuration and statistics are stored **locally**, and all confession/reply messages remain **within Discord** only.

5. Data Retention
------------------
- Configuration and statistics remain on disk unless removed by the Developer or by request from a server administrator.
- Anonymous confessions and replies are retained only within Discord (not by us).

6. Security
------------
We take reasonable care to secure configuration files and local data.
However, no system is 100% secure, and we recommend server owners use Discord’s permission system responsibly to protect log channels and sensitive settings.

7. Children’s Privacy
----------------------
The Bot is not intended for children under 13. Use of the Bot must comply with Discord’s age requirements and local laws.

8. Changes to this Policy
--------------------------
We may update this policy periodically. Continued use of the Bot signifies acceptance of the current Privacy Policy.
